		<h2 hidden>Context</h2>
		<div class="uk-child-width-1-1" uk-grid>
			<h2 style="color: #FFECB3;">Focussing on the 2019-2020 Hong Kong anti-government protests, this is the first media investigation in Malaysia to map how international online disinformation campaigns made its way to our shores and spread within local online communities.</h2>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">From 2019 to 2020, Hong Kong was gripped by a series of mass anti-government protests that brought the financial hub to a standstill. The protests were triggered by fears that a controversial new bill at the time – which would have allowed extraditions to mainland China – could impact Hong Kong’s judicial autonomy and the ‘One country, Two systems’ arrangement.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">In the months that followed the first rally, as peaceful marches swelled in size and escalated into violent confrontations between protesters and police, a parallel information war began playing out between anti-protest and pro-Hong Kong factions in cyberspace.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Unlike the protests themselves which were largely contained within Hong Kong, this information war soon became a disinformation race that involved both China’s state media and anti-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) forces, and which eventually spread to different countries including Malaysia.</p>	
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">In an 8-month long investigation, we sought to trace the origins of false information on the protests which have triggered heated disputes among Malaysians both online and off.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">To understand how such disinformation infiltrated the Malaysian online public sphere, who were the main creators and “importers” of such information, and to gauge its reach, Malaysiakini collected over 11,000 posts published on 384 public Malaysian Facebook pages between June 2019 (when the protests began to peak) and March 2020 that contained keywords related to the protests. We then pored over all posts to identify false and misleading content, and traced their origins and distribution paths.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Disinformation is false information that is deliberately created or disseminated with the express purpose to cause harm. Producers of disinformation typically have political, financial, psychological or social motivations. - <a href="https://firstdraftnews.org/" target="_blank" style="color:#2196F3;">First Draft</a></p>

		<h2 class="uk-heading-small" style="color: #FFECB3;">What we found</h2>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Almost all of the misinformation detected was in Chinese, in either traditional and simplified characters. Out of the 11,482 related posts on Facebook scrutinised, less than 10 percent, or 1,096 posts, were in English and/or Malay. Even then, the majority of these comprised ordinary news reports on the protests, without any apparent bias or leanings.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Meanwhile, most of the detailed online media coverage and materials by other content creators, including misinformation, regarding the protests were communicated in Chinese. This is perhaps due to heightened interest on the matter by Chinese Malaysians, due to their cultural and ethnic ties to mainland China and Hong Kong.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">However, this observation should not be used to dismiss the possibility of disinformation campaigns targeting non-Chinese audiences in Malaysia. You can review our methodology and its limitations (https://kuangkeng.github.io/misinfo-hk/#methodology) at the bottom of this report.</p>

        <h2 class="uk-heading-small" style="color: #FFECB3;">The disinformation ‘importers’</h2>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Mainstream Chinese language media in Malaysia were found to be among the main ‘importers’ of disinformation originating from China state media and other pro-CCP media in Hong Kong.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall">
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We found many news reports about the protests published by local Chinese language mainstream media were taken whole from foreign press including those that are known to be biased and hyper-partisan and which contained elements of untruths concerning the demonstrations. Although specific terms and grammar used in those copied reports were clearly native to China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, evident by the fact no editing or localisation was done to the copy. A small number of those ‘copy-pasted’ reports neglected to credit the original publisher of the reports. A simple search on Google was able to bring up the original reports.</p>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">By republishing the articles (see examples below), local mainstream media not just lent credibility to the disinformation within but amplified them to local audiences, who, in turn, shared the reports through Facebook pages viewed by their followers. Some of the biggest Facebook pages in our dataset have hundreds of thousands of followers, enabling a piece of  disinformation to reach potentially millions of Malaysians within just a few hours.</p>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We have picked three cases from our investigation to illustrate the role of local Chinese media in the spreading of disinformation.</p>

        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Other Chinese dailies declined to comment.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Another foreign news editor at a major local Chinese daily who requested anonymity as he is not authorised to speak on behalf of the publication added that his small team does not have the capacity to verify sources of international news. He claimed it is tough as they can’t reach the foreign individuals reported in the news.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">He pointed out that the rise of social media has also sped up the pace of international news production.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">“Take the Hong Kong protests as an example. Many readers were following breaking news and live reports. Hence we can’t do in-depth reporting on international news as it would be history if we wait until the next day.”</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">“So when we discuss the issue of fake news, we need to consider these factors,” he told Malaysiakini.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Both editors said they know very well the political inclination and bias of different foreign media. Hence they usually try to compile information from different publications across the political spectrum.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">“Our standard operation is news compilation. We know Apple Daily and Wen Wei Po are at the opposite ends of the spectrum. So we will combine the content from both publications and let the readers make their own judgement because we can’t force readers to accept a certain news angle,” explained Liew.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">For the record, our investigation found that such new compilations were produced by Chinese dailies alongside articles taken from pro-Beijing foreign media in whole without any editing. Most misinformation was found in the latter articles, as shown in the examples above.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-justify uk-heading-small" style="color: #FFECB3;" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">‘Not culprit but accomplices’</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Despite the difficulties faced by local Chinese media in verifying foreign news, media lecturer Oung Kang Wei opined that they are still responsible for the spreading of foreign disinformation.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">“Put it this way, they are not the culprit but they are accomplices. We can’t say they are innocent. After all, they are the ones who first laid down the rules recognising Wen Wei Po, Phoenix New Media (which operates ifeng.com), Ta Kung Pao, Xinhua News Agency, China Review News Agency, etc. as official and credible media.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">“Local Chinese media do not create these news because they don’t have first-hand information, but they are the media responsible for reproducing and disseminating such news,” said Oung, who was previously also an international news editor at a local Chinese daily.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">He pointed out that the political inclination of media owners and the conservative nature of local Chinese media also play a role in editorial direction.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">“If the (specific media) owners are pro-Beijing business people, there would be more news favorable to China.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">“The (local) media tends to pay more attention to official statements made by state leaders. Statements from the opposition are usually less (reported). This explains why we saw more content from the perspective of China’s leadership on the issue of the anti-extradition bill because the media would think that these messages have more authority.”</p>

        <h2 class="uk-heading-small" style="color: #FFECB3;">Malaysian Facebook dominated by pro-Beijing voice</h2>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Malaysiakini also discovered that posts on the protests and the comments they attracted were overwhelmingly anti-protesters and pro-Beijing although both sides of the political divide - police and the protesters - resorted to excessive force and violence during the protests.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall">
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">To note, this could be due to the fact the scope of our investigation only focussed on Facebook. Most Facebook posts we compiled were from local Chinese dailies which relied on information from mainstream Hong Kong and China media.</p>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Some of the mainstream media in Hong Kong were clearly on the side of the establishment such as the state-owned Wen Wei Po (文汇报) and Ta Kung Pao (大公报) while their counterparts in China are also state-owned mouthpieces like Global Times (环球时报) and CCTV. </p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">On the other hand, anti-China media such as the various publications under the Falun Gong-affiliated Epoch Times (大纪元时报) that have been churning out disinformation attacking the CCP during the protests were not considered as “official” information by Chinese Malaysian dailies.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">It’s been <a href="https://perma.cc/7Y5J-HXP7" target="_blank">widely reported</a> that both sides of the Hong Kong protests generated and spread disinformation to sway public opinion, but the platforms used by protesters were very different from their rivals. The former, however, preferred instant messaging app <a href="https://perma.cc/7Y5J-HXP7" target="_blank">Telegram</a> that encrypted their messages and protected their identities. It’s hard for information circulated on such platforms to go beyond local users and reach foreign media. Our investigations, however, did not cover any messaging applications. Read more about our <a href="https://kuangkeng.github.io/misinfo-hk/#methodology" target="_blank">methodology</a> at the bottom.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Unverified or false information that can be construed as anti-Beijing or pro-protesters were, instead, more likely to be seen from Facebook pages not operated by local Chinese dailies. For example, NTV7 Mandarin News posted a segment of its <a href="https://perma.cc/8QHT-JCQB" target="_blank">TV news</a> on its Facebook page on Aug 20, 2019, about an armed attack by a man against three pro-democracy youths.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Citing unnamed sources, the report claimed that the attacker, a middle-age man, spoke with a mainland Chinese accent. It’s unclear where this information came from as our online search did not unearth such claims by any <a href="https://perma.cc/K8MH-6VS5" target="_blank"></a>Hong Kong media. The attacker was later arrested and identified as a <a href="https://perma.cc/8KGP-5X4L" target="_blank"></a>Hong Kong resident who is a supporter of the Chinese government.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">NTV7 Mandarin News has since been terminated and merged with 8TV Mandarin News in June 2020.</p>

        <h2 class="uk-heading-small" style="color: #FFECB3;">Joining the skirmish</h2>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;"><span class="uk-text-primary">Aside from this, our investigations identified more than a dozen popular public Facebook pages run by managers based in Malaysia that have been sharing misinformation on the protests. Through their highly partisan posts that include false and misleading information, the pages made it clear which “side” they were on. Videos, articles and news reports with sensational and exaggerated headlines were shared by both pro- and anti-protesters pages. Such content often attracted huge responses from users who shared the same view.</p>

    <div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall">        
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">However, for the record, we found no evidence to indicate these pages were intentionally created to spread misinformation or propaganda for either party. Many of these pages have been active for several years and have built considerable following before the protests erupted.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Most of them can be categorised into three groups - town/state-based communities such as <a href="https://perma.cc/4ZZJ-HTBT" target="_blank">I’m from Penang</a> (我来自槟城), supporters of local political parties like <a href="https://perma.cc/Y36K-H3DV" target="_blank">We Fully Support P.R- D.A.P 我们全力支持民行</a>, and news information sharing pages such as <a href="https://perma.cc/8ERU-H634" target="_blank">FBT News 新闻最前线</a>.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Further analysis of the content posted and shared by these pages found that many of them belonged to networks of pages that amplified each other’s messages by simultaneously posting the same content and cross-sharing content. </p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">However, we could not confirm if the pages were managed by the same people as Facebook only reveals the location of the page managers but not their identities. Our investigation was also only limited to posts on the Hong Kong protests.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">One of those networks identified in our investigation consists of three Facebook pages - <a href="https://perma.cc/8ERU-H634" target="_blank">World news</a> (天下无所不闻), <a href="https://perma.cc/5J7K-VWGE" target="_blank">I can’t find any reason to support BN</a> (我真的找不到支持国阵的理由) and <a href="https://perma.cc/HV9B-YFPX" target="_blank">Return my justice, support Anwar!</a> (还我公正，力挺安华！We Support Anwar！). Combined, they have close to 60,000 likes. </p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">These pages have cross-shared or published some 20 posts with identical content that were either pro-Beijing or anti-protesters. Most of those posts used exaggerated or sensational language containing false information.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">For example, one post about Hong Kong police searching for protesters that vandalised the legislative council building had a message that read, “10 thugs have been convicted! Hong Kong begins citywide search! Foreign ministry denounces UK! Declare war if more interference!” (10名暴徒罪證已定！香港開始全城搜捕！外交部痛斥英國！再干涉就開戰！). Another post about US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s statement that supported the protesters read, “The hand behind Hong Kong protests is caught! China will not spare this 79-year-old American lady!” (香港幕後者，揪出來了！這個79歲美國女人，中國這次絕不饒過。).</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Both posts are no longer available on Facebook. The reasons for their removal was not made clear but they are available in our database [database link] that we have made public.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Almost all their common posts were articles or videos that had been published on Qiqu.live, a content farm targeting Malaysian audiences. This pattern was also found in other networks of pages. They consistently posted articles and videos related to the protests from the same content farm.</p>

		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;"><span class="uk-text-primary">Almost all their common posts were articles or videos published on Qiqu.live, a content farm targeting Malaysian audiences.</span> This pattern was also found in other networks of pages. They consistently posted articles and videos related to the protests from the same content farm. </p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Content farms or content mills refer to websites that publish a large amount of low-quality content, often with sensational titles, to lure clicks and views with the purpose of earning advertising revenue or swaying public opinions. Since their sole purpose is to attract attention, their content often contains misleading and/or false information.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">According to The Reporter, an award-winning investigative journalism website based in Taiwan, a network of hundreds of <a href="https://perma.cc/YQK3-TUZP" target="_blank">content farms</a> targeting Chinese-speaking audiences in Asia was run from Malaysia. The websites in this network include those with “Qiqu” in their domain names like Qiqu.live and Qiqu.pro and those with “KanWatch” like KanWatch.com, KanWatch.me and KanWatch.site.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">A deeper look at Qiqu found that many of the videos it published on the China-US geopolitics originated from pro-Beijing YouTube channels like <a href="https://perma.cc/7X2N-NQPL" target="_blank">时政焦点</a>, <a href="https://perma.cc/T4KX-EHWY" target="_blank">中国新观察</a> and <a href="https://perma.cc/4SBM-JC53" target="_blank">时政热点</a>.</p>

		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">The top official representative of the China government in Malaysia, the Chinese embassy, was also found to be spreading disinformation through its official Facebook page.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Although the page only had a moderate following with less than 29,000 likes when the protests started in June 2019, the number rose to almost 47,000 in March 2020, a 60 percent growth in nine months, according to Crowdtangle data.</p>

		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Serving as an official source of information, local media has been citing information posted by the Facebook page in their news report and treating them as official statements. Hence any information posted on the page has the potential to go beyond its followers and reach more Malaysian audiences through the amplification of local media.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Most of the information posted on its Facebook page is about Chinese history, culture and the achievements of the Chinese government. However, we managed to identify at least two videos shared by the page with misleading or unverified conspiracy theories that the Hong Kong protests were funded and plotted by the West.</p>

				<p>It propagated the conspiracy theory that the protests in Hong Kong, both in 2014 and 2019, were funded by the US through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a US agency funded by the US Congress to promote democracy abroad.

        <h2 class="uk-heading-small" style="color: #FFECB3;">Conclusion</h2>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Malaysiakini’s investigation found that although the disinformation campaign was started by foreign forces with a clear agenda to influence public opinion both local and international, it was brought into Malaysian cyberspace mainly by local players driven by different goals.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Local Chinese language media was found to be passive “importers” of the news whose purpose was  to provide coverage of the protests for local audiences. However, the lack of resources and skills in their newsrooms to filter, curate and fact-check the information before publishing them has led to the amplification and dissemination of largely pro-Beijing disinformation in Malaysia.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">The problem was further aggravated by conventional news operations that preferred mainstream media content from China and Hong Kong – comprising mostly state-controlled and pro-establishment news organisations – and their long-term content-sharing partnership with these media.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">On the other hand, this investigation identified local public Facebook pages that have been actively spreading foreign disinformation originating from China state media and other international anti-Beijing media.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">These Facebook pages, both pro-Beijing and pro-protesters, were able to reach a wide audience not only due to the huge number of followers, but also through coordinated distribution with several pages functioning as a network. For example, as highlighted above, many of them posted shared content with each other at the same time to maximise reach.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Despite such huge influence, there was barely any oversight or action taken by social media platforms such as Facebook and local authorities on the practice. This could be due to the fact that the disinformation was mainly communicated in Chinese, which is not as widely monitored as English and Malay content here. Another reason could be that the content concerned a foreign issue with little, if any, direct impact on domestic affairs.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">According to conservative US-funded think tank Freedom House, the CCP has been aggressively promoting its narratives abroad (https://freedomhouse.org/report/special-report/2020/beijings-global-megaphone) over the past few years through the global expansion of its official state media like People’s Daily, CGTN and Global Times. This is also done through various cooperation between its state media and foreign mainstream media such as providing free content (https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/china-and-the-world-how-beijing-spreads-the-message) for Chinese-language media in other countries, as well as content-sharing and co-production of news programmes. All these were evident in this investigation.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">As global powers up their game in this information war, Malaysians could find themselves further misled, polarised and even exploited if we continue to do nothing. This vulnerability will expose us to more disinformation operations that could one day have greater and more direct influence on local affairs and could cause greater harm.</p>

    <div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall">
        <h4 class="uk-heading-small" style="color: #FFECB3;">Methodology</h4>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We used <a href="https://enterprise.zanroo.com/" target="_blank">Zanroo</a>, a paid social listening and monitoring tool, for our investigation, in order to collate posts from public Malaysian Facebook pages in all three languages (English, Bahasa Malaysia and Chinese) based on a set of keywords related to the Hong Kong protests.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We focused on posts uploaded from June 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. The resulting dataset consisted of 11,482 posts from 384 pages, together with details of each post including the number of engagements, date and time of posting, links and media shared, as well as the number of followers of each page. However, a small number of posts unrelated to the Hong Kong protests were mistakenly included in the dataset as they shared the same keywords.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Due to limited resources, our investigation focused on Facebook as it is the most popular social media platform used by Malaysians. We only covered Facebook pages that are categorised as Malaysian pages based on various criteria including page description, location of page managers, contact number and related websites. The categorisation was done by the team at Zanroo.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Our team then manually inspected the post in the dataset that had received a minimum of 20 engagements. Engagements refer to Facebook reactions (which allow users to respond to a post using emojis to convey different meanings such as like, love, laughter, surprise, anger and sadness), comments and shares received by a post.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We then scrutinised each post for misinformation or other relevant information. If it was a post shared from another page, a YouTube video or web page, we would track and inspect the content for any misinformation.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">For web pages or YouTube videos linked to those Facebook pages, we were able to track how many engagements they  received on different social media platforms and identified which public Facebook pages have also shared them using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crowdtangle-link-checker/klakndphagmmfkpelfkgjbkimjihpmkh" target="_blank">CrowdTangle Link Checker</a>, a Chrome extension.</p>

			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;"><span class="uk-text-primary">Due to Facebook’s privacy terms, we could only extract posts from public pages. Access to all posts from closed pages or individual users are restricted by Facebook. Although we can view the comments posted by personal accounts on public pages, we can’t trace their profiles. Hence we have excluded all comments by personal accounts from our investigation.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;"><span class="uk-text-primary">The dataset of posts by public Malaysian Facebook pages that Zanroo built for us is not exhaustive as pages could have been left out. This is as Zanroo depends on various signals shown on a Facebook page to determine if the page should be categorised as a Malaysian page. For example, a page followed by mostly Malaysian users but do not show any affiliation to Malaysia in its description, managers’ location, contact number or websites might not be categorised as a Malaysian page and included in the dataset.</p>
