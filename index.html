<h2 hidden>Context</h2>
<div class="uk-child-width-1-1" uk-grid>
	<h2>This is the first investigation in Malaysia to look at how online disinformation campaigns originated from outside of the country were brought into our shores and spread within our online community during the anti-government protests in Hong Kong in 2019 and early 2020.</h2>
	<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">The series of street protests that <span class="uk-text-primary">started in June 2019 were triggered by a controversial bill that would have allowed extradition of fugitives to mainland China.</span> As peaceful marches turned into violent confrontations between the protesters and police, a parallel information war erupted between the protesters and the pro-Hong Kong establishment faction in cyberspace.</p>
	<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Unlike the protests which were largely contained within Hong Kong, <span class="uk-text-primary">the information war quickly escalated into a disinformation race that involved China’s state media and other anti-Chinese Communist Party (CCP) forces.</span> Their campaigns have generated a huge amount of false information that were spread to different countries including Malaysia triggering heated disputes among Malaysians both online and offline.</p>
	<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">To further understand how such disinformation was brought into the public space of Malaysian online communities, who are the main creators and “importers” of such material and how far is the reach, <span class="uk-text-primary">we collected 11,482 posts from 384 Malaysian public Facebook pages published between June 2019 to March 2020 that contain keywords related to the protests.</span> We then pored over all posts to identify false or misleading content and trace their origin and distribution paths.</p>

			Disinformation is false information that is deliberately created or disseminated with the express purpose to cause harm.

    <h2 class="uk-heading-small">What we found</h2>
    <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-slide-right; delay: 300;">Almost all of the misinformation that we found was communicated in Chinese language in either traditional and simplified characters. <span class="uk-text-primary">Out of the 11,482 posts on Facebook that we collect, only around 10 percent of 1,096 posts are in English or Malay.</span> Most of those posts are ordinary news reports about the protests without strong bias.</p>
    <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-slide-right; delay: 300;">This is not surprising as the development of Hong Kong politics is always an issue that many Chinese Malaysians care about. Most of the detailed media coverage and materials including misinformation about the protests were also communicated in Chinese language by the media and other content creators. <span class="uk-text-primary">However, this observation should not be used to dismiss the possibility that there are disinformation campaigns that target non-Chinese audiences in Malaysia</span> as our methodology has several limitations which you can read about them in the bottom of this report.</p>

        <h2 class="uk-heading-small">The disinformation ‘importers’: local Chinese media</h2>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Chinese language mainstream media is one of the main ‘importers’ of disinformation originated from China’s state media and other pro-CCP Hong Kong media.</p>

    <div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall">
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We found many news reports about the protests published by local Chinese language mainstream media were taken in whole from foreign media including those that are known to be biased and hyper-partisan. <span class="uk-text-primary">Although specific terms and grammar used in those ‘copy-paste’ are clearly native to China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, no editing or localization was done to them.</span> A small number of those ‘copy-paste’ reports did not even credit the original publisher but a simple search on Google would reveal the original reports.</p>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">By republishing these disinformation, <span class="uk-text-primary">local mainstream media not just lent credibility to them but amplified them to local audiences through local Facebook pages that like to share reports from local media with their followers.</span> Some of the biggest Facebook pages in the dataset that we collected have hundreds thousands of followers, enabling the disinformation to reach potentially millions of Malaysians in a matter of hours.</p>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We have picked <span style="color: #FFEB3B;">four cases from our investigation</span> to illustrate the role of local Chinese media in the disinformation campaign.</p>

	<p>The Facebook post quickly attracted comments that questioned the sources and the images of the story. According to the post’s edit history, the status, image and title of the post were all updated 83 minutes after it was posted. The new status read “Police press conference video inside” and the new image was a collage of the two photos showing fire near busses and a screenshot of CGTN video featuring a police spokesperson claiming a fire was started in front of a school bus.</p>

<p>We noticed that this unverified information was used by both sides of the political divide to attack their rivals. Supporters of the establishment quoted the figure to highlight the damage done by the protests while the pro-protesters media including the New Tang Dynasty Television (https://perma.cc/L2RG-JGSG) and Epoch Times (https://perma.cc/8CYL-TX95) used it in reports claiming the Malaysian government has rejected the migration applications of Hong Kong police personnel.</p>    
<p>The “7,500 applications from Hong Kongers between January to October 2019” claim is far from the official statistics under the MM2H program. According to the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture (https://perma.cc/EH65-HGCE), the program received a total of 7,904 applications in 2019 from all over the world. Although county breakdown was not revealed, it is unlikely that 7,500 out of the 7,904 came from Hong Kong. Reuters also reported (https://perma.cc/34AJ-AR5M) that the program only received 251 applications from Hong Kong between January and the end of August 2019.</p>
<p>Although the official figures have been reported by both local and foreign media and more details could have been obtained from local authorities, both Kwong Wah Daily and See Hua Daily News failed to verify the information before republishing the story.</p>

        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">We also discovered that the posts and the comments they attracted are overwhelmingly <span class="uk-text-primary">anti-protesters and pro-Beijing although both sides of the political divide - the police and the protesters -</span> have resorted to excessive force and violence during the protests.</p>

    <div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall">
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">This could be caused by the scope of our investigation that only focused on Facebook. Most of the Facebook posts that we compiled are from local Chinese dailies which rely on information from mainstream media in Hong Kong and China. Some of the mainstream media in Hong Kong are clearly on the side of the establishment such as Wen Wei Po (文汇报) and Ta Kung Pao (大公报) while their counterparts in China are mostly state-owned mouthpieces like Global Times (环球时报) and CCTV. On the other hand, anti-China media like the various publications under the Falun Gong-affiliated Epoch Times (大纪元时报) that have been churning out disinformation attacking the CCP during the protests were not considered as ‘official’ information by local Chinese dailies.</p>
        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">It was widely reported (https://perma.cc/7Y5J-HXP7) that both sides generated and spread disinformation to sway public opinion but the platforms used by the protesters were very different from their rivals. They preferred messaging application Telegram that encrypts their messages and also protects their identity. It is hard for Information circulated on such platforms to go beyond local users and reach foreign media. Our investigation did not include any messaging applications. Read more about our methodology at the bottom.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Unverified or false information that can be construed as anti-Beijing or pro-protesters were more likely to be seen from Facebook pages not operated by local Chinese dailies. For example, NTV7 Mandarin News posted a segment of its tv news (https://perma.cc/8QHT-JCQB) on its Facebook page on Aug 20, 2019 about an armed attack by a man against three pro-democracy youths.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Citing unnamed sources, the report claimed that the attacker, a middle-age man, spoke with a mainland Chinese accent. It was unclear where this information came from as our online search could not find any Hong Kong media (https://perma.cc/K8MH-6VS5) that mentioned the accent. The attacker was later arrested and identified as a Hong Kong resident (https://perma.cc/8KGP-5X4L) who is pro-Beijing.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">NTV7 Mandarin News was terminated and merged with 8TV Mandarin News this June.</p>

        <p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Our investigation has identified more than a dozen of popular public Facebook pages run by managers based in Malaysia that have been sharing misinformation about the protests. Through their highly partisan posts that include false and misleading information, the pages made it clear which side they were on. Videos, articles and news reports with sensationalizing and exaggerating headlines were shared by both pro- and anti-protesters pages. Such content often attracted huge responses from users who shared the same view. </p>

    <div class="uk-container uk-container-xsmall">        
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">However, it should be stressed that we found no evidence that indicates these pages were intentionally created to spread misinformation or propaganda for either side of the protests. Many of them have been active for several years and have built considerable following before the protests erupted.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Most of them can be categorized into three groups - town/state based communities like “I’m from Penang” (我来自槟城) (https://perma.cc/4ZZJ-HTBT), supporters of local political parties like “We Fully Support P.R- D.A.P 我们全力支持民行” (https://perma.cc/Y36K-H3DV), and news information sharing pages like “FBT News 新闻最前线” (https://perma.cc/8ERU-H634).</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Further analysis of the content posted and shared by these pages found that many of them belong to networks of pages that amplified their messages by simultaneously posting the same content across different pages and cross-sharing those content. This could mean those pages were managed by the same people but we could not confirm this as Facebook only reveals the location of the page managers but not their identities and our investigation is only limited to posts on the Hong Kong protests.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">One of those networks identified in our investigation consists of three Facebook pages - “World news” (https://perma.cc/8ERU-H634) (天下无所不闻), “I can’t find any reason to support BN” (https://perma.cc/5J7K-VWGE) (我真的找不到支持国阵的理由) and “Return my justice, support Anwar!“ (https://perma.cc/HV9B-YFPX) (还我公正，力挺安华！We Support Anwar！). They have a combined number of almost 60,000 likes. </p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">They have cross-shared or published some 20 posts with identical content that was pro-Beijing or anti-protesters. Most of those posts used exaggerated or sensational language with false information. For example, one post about Hong Kong police searching for protesters that vandalised the legislative council building has a message that read “Ten thugs have been convicted! Hong Kong begins a citywide search! Foreign ministry denounces UK! Declare war if more interference!” (10名暴徒罪證已定！香港開始全城搜捕！外交部痛斥英國！再干涉就開戰！). Another post about US House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s statement that supports the protesters read “The hand behind Hong Kong protests is caught! China will not spare this 79-year-old American lady!” (香港幕後者，揪出來了！這個79歲美國女人，中國這次絕不饒過。).</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Both posts are not available on Facebook anymore. The reasons are not clear but they are available in our database [database link] that we have made public.</p>
		
		<div>inline image - [qiqu-webpage.jpg]</div>
		
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Almost all their common posts were articles or videos published on Qiqu.live, a content farm targeting Malaysian audiences. This pattern was also found in other networks of pages. They consistently posted articles and videos related to the protests from the same content farm. </p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Content farms or content mills refer to websites that publish a large amount of low-quality content often with sensational titles to lure clicks and views with the purpose to earn advertising revenue or sway public opinions. Since their sole purpose is to attract attention, their content often contains misleading and false information.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">According to The Reporter, an award-winning investigative journalism website based in Taiwan, a network of hundreds of content farms (https://perma.cc/YQK3-TUZP) targeting Chinese speaking audiences in Asia was run from Malaysia. The websites in this network include those with “Qiqu” in their domain names like Qiqu.live and Qiqu.pro and those with “KanWatch” like KanWatch.com, KanWatch.me and KanWatch.site.</p>
		<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">A deeper look at Qiqu found that many of the videos it published on the China-US geopolitics originated from pro-Beijing Youtube channels like 时政焦点 (https://perma.cc/7X2N-NQPL), 中国新观察 (https://perma.cc/T4KX-EHWY) and 时政热点 (https://perma.cc/4SBM-JC53). </p>

			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">This project used Zanroo (https://enterprise.zanroo.com/), a paid social listening and monitoring tool, to collect posts from Malaysian public Facebook pages in all three languages (English, Malay and Chinese) based on a set of keywords related to the Hong Kong protests posted from 1 June 2019 to 31 March 2020. The resulting dataset consists of 11,482 posts from 384 pages together with other details of each post including number of engagements, date and time of posting, link and media shared, and number of followers. However, there is a small number of posts unrelated to Hong Kong protests but mistakenly included in the dataset because they share the same keywords.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Due to limited resources, our investigation focuses on Facebook as it is the most popular social media platform used by Malaysians. We only cover Facebook pages that are categorized as Malaysian pages based on various criteria including their page description, location of the managers, contact number and related websites. Such categorization is done by the team at Zanroo.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">Our team then manually inspected each post in the dataset which received 20 and more engagements. Engagement is the total of all reactions (like, love, care, wow, haha, angry, sad), comments and shares received by a post. For each post, we identified if it contains misinformation or other relevant information. If it shares a post from another source, a Youtube video or links to other web pages, we would track and inspect their content for any misinformation.</p>
			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">For web pages or Youtube videos that are linked from those Facebook pages, we were able to track how many engagements they have received on different social media platforms and identify which public Facebook pages have also shared them using the CrowdTangle Link Checker (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/crowdtangle-link-checker/klakndphagmmfkpelfkgjbkimjihpmkh), a Chrome extension.</p>

			<p class="uk-text-large uk-text-justify" uk-scrollspy="cls: uk-animation-fade; delay: 300;">The dataset of posts by Malaysian public Facebook pages that Zanroo built for us is not exhaustive as Zanroo depends on various signals shown on a Facebook page to determine if the page should be categorized as a Malaysian page. For example, a page that is followed by mostly Malaysian users but does not show any affiliation to Malaysia in its description, managers’ location, contact number or websites might not be categorized as a Malaysian page and included in the dataset.</p>
